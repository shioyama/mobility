  # will catch the suffix and convert it into a locale in +method_missing+. If
  # you don't need this kind of open-ended fallthrough behavior, it's better
  # to use locale_accessors instead (which define methods) since method_missing
  # is very slow. (You can use both fallthrough and locale accessor plugins
  # together without conflict.)

  # backend, you can set that as a default by uncommenting this line, or change
  # it to :string to default to the string-type translation table instead. (For
  # other backends, this option is ignored.)
